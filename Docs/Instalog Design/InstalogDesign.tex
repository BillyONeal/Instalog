\section{Introduction}
This document explains how the Instalog tool will be implemented.  This document
is a work in progress and will be updated as features of the tool are
approached.  Since the scanning features are being developed currently, they are
the only features currently designed in this document.  However, since the
scanning features depend on things like scripting and rudimentary user
interfaces, these are also discussed in this document.
