\section{Abstract} \label{abstract}
The Microsoft Windows operating system is a complicated system.  When it is
working, everything is fine.  However, when something goes wrong, it is often a
frustrating experience troubleshooting what the problem is, so frequently the
easiest fix is to backup the machine and then reformat it and reinstall Windows.
This approach can severely impact productivity and is complicated for
non-technical users.  

One common source of problems for users of the Windows operating system is
infection from malware.  This has caused there to be a sizable market for
antimalware software.  This software is very effective at removing common
infections because at a high level, the software vendors simply need to maintain
a list of common infections and the safe way to remove them.  Some tools are
even moderately effective at removing unknown threats by using heuristic
techniques.  However, these techniques have limited effectiveness especially
against obscure or new malware.  

Therefore, a demand exists for tools that aid users in removing these obscure
malware infections.  This project, Instalog, is a response to this need. 
Instalog is designed to be a tool with two purposes: information gathering and
system repair.

First, it scans Windows installations to gather as much information as possible
about the machine.  It then filters this information using whitelists to remove
mundane information like system defaults.  It outputs a log of information that
is non-standard on the machine which will hopefully aid an expert in identifying
what the root cause of an infection is.

Second, Instalog provides a capacity to fix infections.  Given a log output,
experts can generate scripts to fix an infection either by hand or by using the
GUI.  Instalog can run these scripts to remove an infection.  

Instalog is designed such that it can support three different ``user classes.'' 
The first is that of a ``home user'' that has an infected machine but doesn't
know how to fix it.  This user can use Instalog to scan their machine and then
post it online to get assistance.  Here, an ``expert'' can download the ``home
user's'' log, analyze it, and produce a fix script for them to run.  The ``home
user'' can then download this script and run it using Instalog to fix their
machine.  This process may involve several iterations.  The other user case is
that of a ``system administrator'' that plays both roles -- ``system
administrators'' use Instalog to scan their machines and know enough about the
machine to generate and run a suitable fix script.

\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
\subsection{Background}
There most certainly is a real need for this product.  In the Related Work
section before, other similar products are listed.  However, they all have their
associated problems and have not been maintained.  There are security
communities online such as Malware Bytes that use these tools to analyze and fix
users' machines.  These forums serve thousands of people a year, and the tools
are downloaded even more frequently after year.  Once this tool is fully
developed, the hope is that this will become the de-facto standard and replace
other tools.

\subsection{Related Work}
Instalog is inspired by several similar tools which all share some basic
functionality.  In many ways, Instalog can be viewed as an evolution of
these tools:

\begin{itemize}
    \item TrendMicro's {\em Hijack This} (HJT)
    \item ``sUBs'' {\em Doesn't Do Squat} (DDS)
    \item ``random/random'''s {\em Random's System Information Tool} (RSIT)
    \item ``OldTimer'''s {\em OTA}, {\em OTS}, and {\em OTL} (formerly
    OTAnalyzeIt, OTScanIt, and OTListIt, respectively)
    \item Sysinternals' {\em Autoruns}
    \item Runscanner's {\em Runscanner}
\end{itemize}

All of these tools purport to accomplish similar goals to Instalog. However,
each of these tools has bugs or specific behavior which cause problems for at
least one of Instalog's three intended user groups.  Specifically, the above
tools contain one or more of the above problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorrect handling and escaping of log data
    \item Lack of published specifications, documentation, or source code
    \item Outstanding bugs that the authors are unwilling or unable to fix
    \item Lack of scriptability, for the purposes of modifying log output and
    malware removal.
    \item Lack of 64 bit support.
    \item Lack of Unicode support.
    \item Lack of enumeration of some types of useful log information.
\end{itemize}

Instalog will attempt to solve those problems by combining characteristics of
the above tools which are deemed useful while mixing in a few tricks of its
own.

TrendMicro's {\em Hijack This} was open-sourced recently.  The authors of this
project have briefly looked through the project to see if it is worth forking
the project to implement Instalog.  It was determined that the source code is
not up to par.  Not only is it written in Visual Basic, the licensing agreement
is GPL, which means that any work done could not be used in closed-source
settings, which is against the wishes of the authors.

\subsection{Progress}
At the time of the last report, we had finished the scaffolding parts and had
just began actually implementation scanning sections.  Since then, progress has
been much slower due to heavy courseload in other classes.  Despite this,
however, we have finished most of what we set out to do under the revised scope
limit.  In fact, the only thing that we were not able to finish is parts of the
Pseudo Hijack This report, which will be finished once the semester is up.  We
also implemented Spoofed DNS check even though this was not part of the features
to be implemented under the scope limit. We have identified a few tweaks that we
would like to do once this is finished before we start work on the scripting
functionality, but for the most part, things have gone pretty well with the
implementation.

Lastly, support for Windows XP RTM and Windows XP Service Pack 1 has been
restored because a rather simple work-around was found to support compiling for
these operating systems with Visual Studio 2010.  However, support for Windows
2000 has been permanently dropped because this tool simply requires too many
features that are not available on Windows 2000 and the operating system no
longer receives security updates from Microsoft (making security on the
operating system an impossible matter).

\subsection{Report Structure}
This report is structured using a modified version of the structure proposed in
\cite{ReportGuidelines}.

This report begins with the proposed Abstract (section~\ref{abstract}),
Introduction (section~\ref{introduction}), and Application
(section~\ref{application}) sections.  The Methodology section is not an
explicit section in this document as it has been integrated into the other
documentation of the project.  Therefore, the report dives straight into the
heart of the documentation of the project in the Software Design section
(section~\ref{software_design}).  Since the documentation for this project is
extremely long, this section simply introduces the documents and references them
as external documents.  The proposed User Interface section has been included in
the documents listed in the Software Design section.  Similarly, the proposed
Testing and Evaluation section has been merged into the Software Design section
as a separate stand-alone document. This report then introduces the
aforementioned Scope Limit (section~\ref{scope_limit}) and then moves into the
finer points of the Project Management and Administrative Details
(section~\ref{project_management}).  It concludes with Lessons Learned
(section~\ref{lessons}) and Conclusions, Final Status, and Future Work
(section~\ref{conclusions}). The report then references any additional external
documents in the External Documents section (section~\ref{documents}) and then
lists all of the references made in the document in the References section. 
Lastly, the report mentions the legal details for the project in the License
appendix (appendix~\ref{license}).

\newpage



\section{Application} \label{application}
Instalog can be seen as having three different distinct components:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Scanning
  \item Scripting and Repairing
  \item GUI
\end{enumerate}

Each of these components will be expanded on in the following subsections.

\subsection{Scanning}
Instalog's scanning abilities are the information-gathering and whitelist
capabilities that will be provided to the user.  Instalog will scan a number of
different types of information such as registry keys, browser settings, and
recently modified files.  These different information points are picked because
they are primarily ``loading points,'' that is, they are locations that malware
would need to modify to be loaded.  Each information point will be filtered
using whitelists that will remove default values and values that are known to be
safe.  What will be left is information that is unique to the user's computer,
hopefully some of which provides information about the malware.

A big challenge with this is the sheer amount of data that is being included in
the scan.  The Instalog project team plan on getting around this by writing
meticulously detailed requirements and specifications documents to make sure
each behavior is well defined before starting to implement the project.
Another challenge with this is making the scan run quickly.  The biggest
challenge is to simply test the scanning behavior.  Since it is impossible to
anticipate every possible machine configuration, the software must be robust
enough to handle varying scenarios across all of the targeted versions of
Windows.

\subsection{Scripting and Repairing}
The next component is Instalog's ability to run scripts and repair systems. 
Instalog will define a scripting language that enables common actions such as
process killing, registry actions, and file quarantine.  It will also provide
scripting actions to run all of the available scanning actions.  This will allow
a script to gather more information about a system if necessary.  

The biggest challenge to this is similar to the scanning challenge -- it will be
very difficult to thoroughly test this.  It is \textit{imperative} that this
functionality is tested extensively though because one mistake in this component
could lead to data loss on a user's machine.  

\subsection{GUI}
The final component of Instalog is the graphical user interface (GUI).  This
interface will allow users to run scans, run scripts, and build scripts based on
scan outputs.  The challenge here is building the GUI using the native GUI
controls, especially since some of the proposed screens such as the script
builder are incredibly complex.  Additionally, the script builder must be tested
heavily as well, because if a poor script is built, this could also lead to data
loss on a user's machine.  

\newpage



\section{Software Design} \label{design}
The nature of this tool is that there are a lot of small little features that
collectively make up each component mentioned in the Application section
(section~\ref{application}).  Alone, each small feature of the tool is quite
manageable and straightforward.  However, when all of the pieces are put
together, there is actually an impressive amount of detail and small nuances
that are required to adequately explain each feature.  Therefore, instead of
including the Software Requirements, Software Specifications, Software Design,
and Testing and Validation documents in this report, they have been written and
included as stand-alone documents.  This was done with the intent of making this
document more readable as well as making each document more maintainable when
they inevitably have to be updated or modified throughout the product
development lifecycle.  Each document is briefly introduced, explained, and
referenced in the following subsections.  Please refer to the specified
documents for more details.

\subsection{Software Requirements}
\label{software_requirements}
The Software Requirements document \cite{Requirements} is designed to be read by
a mostly non-technical audience.  It describes the various features that the
project will have and what criteria these features must meet to be considered
implemented successfully.  This document is written at a fairly high-level view
as the problem space is fairly well defined for this project.

\subsection{Software Requirements Specifications}
\label{software_specifications}
The Software Requirements Specifications document \cite{Specification} is the
document that visits each requirement in the above Software Requirements
document.  This document is quite long because it describes in meticulous detail
how each feature will function, how it must behave, where the data will be
pulled from, etc.  The intent of this document is that it will make the actual
design, implementation, and testing of the project much easier because the
behavior is well defined from the start.  This document has also been released
in private security volunteer circles for validation, and has been modified
slightly at the suggestions of a few individuals.

\subsection{Software Design}
\label{software_design}
The Design document \cite{Design} is the document that describes how the
requirements will be implemented.  This document is currently a work in progress
and explains the progress made and current plan for remaining items.  Please
note that it does \textit{not} attempt to document the features that are not
part of the scope limit.  This being said, however, it does have some plans made
for things such as scripting and user interfaces.  

\subsection{Testing and Validation}
\label{testing_and_evaluation}
The Testing and Validation document \cite{Testing} is the document that
describes how the tool will be evaluated.  Since the Requirements
Document \cite{Requirements} and Software Requirements Specification
\cite{Specification} document describe each facet of the tool in extreme
detail, the expected behavior of the tool must just match the requirements.  The
Testing and Validation document is a brief document that describes the approach
in the project to testing, specifically unit testing.  It will be updated as the
project progresses to reflect the integration and system testing that will be
done once more of the project is completed.

\newpage



\section{Scope Limit} \label{scope_limit}
The scope of this project is much larger than can be reasonably finished in the
time-frame for the course.  It had taken five weeks just to write the
requirements and specifications for the project.  Therefore, due to the sheer
amount of features this tool will have as well as the amount of testing on
varying environments that will be required, at the suggestion of the professor
of the Senior Project course, the authors have instituted a scope limit for the
completion of the project.  

The initial scope limit was to work on scanning features first and then
implement the below features in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Scripting 
    \item GUI 
    \item Enumeration of Firefox data
    \item Enumeration of Google Chrome data
    \item Spoofed DNS check
    \item ``Value Added'' scripting actions, such as MRC upload or VirusTotal
    upload
    \item Checkboxes and fix generation on the GUI
\end{enumerate}

At the time of the second interim report, it was suggested that the scope for
the project by the final deadline be scaled back more.  It was decided that work
would continue on the project at the same pace and if features that were
originally promised were unimplemented or untested, they would be added to the
scope limit and implemented after the semester had ended.  Everything has been
finished under the revised scope limit with the exception of about half of the
Psuedo Hijack This features.  However, Spoofed DNS check was implemented (which
was not part of the features to be implemented under the scope limit).

The authors of this tool will complete any remaining deliverables outside of the
Senior Project course in the free time between when classes and summer
internships / employment begins.  

\newpage



\section{Project Management and Administrative Details}
\label{project_management} 
When the concept for this project was originally realized, the intent was that
the entire project would be implemented, tested, and shippable by the end of the
Senior Project class.  However, since the authors have other courses as well as
jobs and extra-curricular activities, it gradually became evident that the
original timeline would not be even remotely feasible.  For instance, the
original hope was the entire Software Requirements Specification
\cite{Specification} would be finished in a day over the weekend.  Despite
working on the document for an entire weekend, the document was not finished in
the intended time period.  In fact, it took several weeks to finish the
document.  

Around the due date of the Project Proposal, the authors spent some time
developing a realistic view of the project.  Out of this came the Scope Limit
(section~\ref{scope_limit}) explained in the preceding section.  It was decided
that instead of letting standards slip and shipping a shoddy product that could
potentially ruin users' machines, that instead the first component of the
product would be implemented and tested well.  Then, after the course, work
would continue on the remaining items.  The hope was that since the
Specification Document was written so thoroughly, the implementation and testing
will not be as time consuming and that the timeline can be shortened and more
features can be implemented.

However, even given the conservative scope limit, everything was not completed
as the authors had hoped.  Several roadblocks were encountered including needing
to wrap two more clunky Windows APIs, having to redesign the scripting and
whitelisting implementations, and having other courses (primarily EECS 391) take
up a large portion of the authors' available time.  As such, all the features
were not completed as originally hoped and testing did not happen on all target
operating systems.  However, most features were implemented (all the remains is
a few remaining features from Psuedo Hijack This which shouldn't take more than
a couple days' time to finish).

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/GanttChart.png}
  	\caption{Gantt Chart}
  	\label{gantt}
\end{figure}

In the end, the authors were not able to entirely meet the timeline.  Despite
pushing testing into development and having essentially an extra week to work on
the project (because the demo was a week later than first anticipated), progress
still came up a bit short.  This being said, the authors are very pleased with
what \textit{did} get finished and look forward to finishing the rest of the
project in the future.  

In hindsight, it is obvious that if over fifty days were spent on the
requirements, specifications, and design documents, then it is extremely
unrealistic to finish the implementation and testing in just over forty days. 
The scope limit should have more realistic from the start, but the schedule was
a bit too optimistic.

The authors of this tool began by using pair programming at the beginning of the
project.  Once a good common ground had been established, the authors split off
work and began implementing separate scanning sections in a test driven
development method.  

\newpage



\section{Lessons Learned} \label{lessons}
The biggest lesson we learned is that everything takes longer than we originally
think it will.  It seems that in all of our time estimates, we were way off on
how long we thought it would take to do things versus how long they actually
took.  The first time this happened was when we were initially writing the
requirements, specification, and design documents.  Initially, we thought that
we would be able to get them done in a weekend!  This wound up taking us
\textit{weeks} of time.  Once we had finished that, in the remaining time, we
thought that we would be able to implement the entire project and test it on all
supported operating systems!  Not surprisingly (thinking back on it now), this
was also way off.  We then limited our scope drastically to something that we
thought was reasonable.  Even still though, we were not able to finish that.  To
be clear, this isn't because we were lazy and didn't work on things until the
last minute.  We worked diligently over the entire semester (we even worked
straight through spring break) and still did not finish what we set out to do. 
So this is most certainly the biggest takeaway from this project: even the
simplest of things take several times longer than you expect them to.

Another big takeaway from this project is the benefit of doing things ``the
right way``.  What we mean by this is following proper software engineering
practices -- writing good documentation, using version control, unit testing,
etc.  While each of these concepts has a high up-front cost (meaning that we
weren't able to start coding right away), they saved us a lot of time in the
long run.  Unfortunately, since the project is still not done, the ``long run''
extends far past the end of this class.  So, if we had not followed these
practices, we probably would have more code and features done at this point, but
they would have been poorly tested and planned out, making maintenance and
adding future features a nightmare.  By planning everything out ahead of time,
we saved ourselves a lot of frustration of reworking everything again and again.
 Additionally, by having a detailed specification document, ``experts'' that
will be using this tool will know exactly how each feature works (something that
cannot be said for most of the other tools in the field currently).

\newpage



\section{Conclusions, Final Status, and Future Work} \label{conclusions}
At this point, we did not finish everything that we had hoped to finish with the
scope limit (see section~\ref{scope_limit}).  However, what we did finish has
been well tested and documented.  We have finished the following ``scaffolding''
sections, which correspond to a large proportion of the specification document
(\cite{Specification}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item A runtime dynamic linker
  \item A wrapper around Win32 and NT error messages to convert them to C++
  exceptions
  \item A wrapper around Win32 Processes Handles
  \item A wrapper around Win32 File Handles
  \item A privilege granting wrapper
  \item Path manipulation functions
  \item String functions including escaping and unescaping
  \item Pre-defined output formats from the specification
  \item Whitelisting support
  \item A wrapper around the registry
  \item Rudimentary scripting, reordering, and execution
  \item Framework for developing and reporting progress back to user interfaces
  \item A wrapper around Win32 Service Control Manager 
  \item A message formatter
  \item A wrapper around the ``new'' and ``old'' event viewer
  \item A wrapper around DNS querying
\end{itemize}

From these ``scaffolding'' pieces, the following scanning sections have been
implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Running Processes
  \item Psuedo Hijack This (in progress, the features in this section
  correspond to the majority the specification \cite{Specification})
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spoofed DNS Check
\end{itemize}
  \item Services and Drivers
  \item Created Last 30
  \item Find3M
  \item Event Viewer
  \item Machine Specifications
  \item Restore Points
  \item Installed Programs
\end{itemize}

It was suggested after interim report 2 that we narrow the scope of our initial
scope limit, so we feel that we have been successful in getting a healthy amount
of work on the project done.  As it is, there are only a few more parts of
Psuedo Hijack This to finish (which shouldn't take more than a few days of
solid work without the distraction of classes, homework, and finals).

After the scanning sections are complete, we would like to do a few tweaks
before letting moderators on ``expert forums'' test the tool on their own
systems.  First, we would like to implement better whitelisting infrastructure
and whitelists in general.  Two weeks ago, we began refactoring the whitelisting
infrastructure but realized this would prevent us from finishing a lot of the
features we originally promised.  This work was shelved, and the majority of the
remaining features were finished.  However, right now, the log output is too
long to be useful, so whitelisting is a major must.  Second, we would like to
implement a mock registry so that we can actually test Psuedo Hijack This
(which is currently just tested based on the output which is not sufficient). 
After this, we will be comfortable releasing the tool to ``forum experts'' and
then the greater community once any final bugs are addressed.

After this, it is our intent to begin implementing the remaining portions of
this tool.  We don't know when this will be finished, however, as our schedules
over the summer are still undetermined and we aren't very good at estimating how
long things will take us.  

\newpage



\section{External Documents} \label{documents}
\subsection{User's Manual}
The user's manual \cite{Manual} explains how to run the tool as a user.  At this
point, it is extremely simple, but also contains information on how to report
bugs if there's issues.  

\subsection{Developer Documentation}
All of the code documentation for this tool is written in Doxygen.  Since the
documentation is always changing (it evolves with the code), the authors do not
provide a pre-built version of it for download (with one exception: a build of
the documentation as of a day before the due date is pre-built for convenience).
The documentation can be built fairly easily according to the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and install the latest version of Doxygen (1.8.0 as of this
writing)
\item In Visual Studio, go to ``Tools->External Tools''
\item Click ``Add''
\item In the ``Title'' field, put something meaningful like Doxygen
\item In the ``Command'' field, click the ... button and navigate to the Doxygen
executable  \\ (\verb|C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin\doxygen.exe| by default)
\item Paste \verb|$(SolutionDir)\Docs\Doxygen\Doxyfile| into the ``Arguments''
field 
\item Paste \verb|$(SolutionDir)| into the ``Initial directory'' field 
\item Check ``Use Output window'' and make sure ``Prompt for arguments'' and
``Treat output as Unicode'' are unchecked 
\item Press ``OK'' 
\item Go to ``Tools->External Tools->Doxygen'' and wait for the build to finish
(check the Output window) 
\item Navigate to wherever you cloned the Instalog repository, and go to
\verb|Docs/Doxygen/html| and open \verb|index.html|
\end{enumerate}
