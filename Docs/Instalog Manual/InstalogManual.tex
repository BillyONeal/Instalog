\section{Using Instalog}
Running Instalog is really easy!  Once you have the tool downloaded, just double
click it to run it.  If you are Windows Vista or Windows 7, a window may pop up
asking your permission to run the tool.  This is because Instalog requires
administrator privileges to run because it accesses sensitive portions of the
system.  Just say ``Yes'' in this window.  Instalog will then run and display a
black command prompt window indicating its progress.  Once it is done scanning
your system, it will create a file called ``\verb|Instalog.txt|'' in the same
place that you saved the Instalog executable to.  This contains the results from
the scan.  This is what you would post to forums or other help channels for
assistance.  

If you are interested in interpreting the log output yourself, all of the
features are well documented in the Instalog Specification document.  Read
through the relevant portions of the document to learn how to interpret the log.

\section{Reporting Problems}
Instalog is still under development, and as such, may still have issues in it. 
If you encounter unusual behavior while running the tool, please head to the
Instalog website and report a bug.  In the bug report, please include the log
output as well as any other relevant information that may help us replicate the
issues you are having.
