\section{Repair Actions} \label{sec:repair_actions}
This section defines all of the ``repair'' actions that Instalog will support. 
These actions modify the system's configuration in some way and are as such
considered ``system-altering'' actions. \label{systemaltering}

\subsection{File Quarantine (\texttt{:Move})}
This simple action will put files into quarantine.  This action does not require
any arguments, but does require a list of \var{items} (\ref{sec:script_syntax})
to move into quarantine.  Each file in \var{items}, shall be placed into
quarantine according to the scheme defined in \ref{sec:file_backup}.

If adding the file to the compressed archive fails, then the tool must not
attempt to delete the file.  If adding the file to the archive fails or deleting
the file fails, then the quarantine action for the file shall be considered
failed.  Otherwise, the action shall be considered a success.  

Each file shall be emitted to the log according to the scheme defined in
\ref{repairoutput}.

\subsection{Hosts File Reset (\texttt{:HostsReset})}

This action resets the hosts file (\verb|%WinDir%\System32\Drivers\Etc\hosts|)
to a default hosts file only containing entry(s) for localhost.  First, it
shall backup the hosts file according to the scheme defined in
\ref{sec:file_backup}.  If the backup fails, then the operation shall be
emitted to the log as failed according \ref{repairoutput}.
Once the file is backed up, the hosts file shall be replaced with a simple
hosts file.  The host file varies based on the operating system:

\begin{description}
\item[Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 and older] \hfill 
\begin{verbatim}
# Hosts file reset by Instalog

127.0.0.1       localhost
\end{verbatim}
\item[Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008] \hfill 
\begin{verbatim}
# Hosts file reset by Instalog

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
\end{verbatim}
\item[Windows 7] \hfill 
\begin{verbatim}
# Hosts file reset by Instalog

# localhost resolution handled within DNS
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

The status of the write operation shall be written to the log according to
\ref{repairoutput}.
