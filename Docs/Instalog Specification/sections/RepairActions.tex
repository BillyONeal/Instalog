\section{Repair Actions} \label{sec:repair_actions}
This section defines all of the ``repair'' actions that Instalog will support. 
These actions modify the system's configuration in some way and are as such
considered ``system-altering'' actions. \label{systemaltering}

\subsection{File Quarantine (\texttt{:move})}
This simple action will put files into quarantine.  This action does not require
any arguments, but does require a list of \var{items} (\ref{sec:script_syntax})
to move into quarantine.  Each file in \var{items}, shall be placed into
quarantine according to the scheme defined in \ref{sec:file_backup}.

If adding the file to the compressed archive fails, then the tool must not
attempt to delete the file.  If adding the file to the archive fails or deleting
the file fails, then the quarantine action for the file should be considered
failed.  Otherwise, the action should be considered a success.  

Each file should be emitted to the log according to the scheme defined in
\ref{repairoutput}.
