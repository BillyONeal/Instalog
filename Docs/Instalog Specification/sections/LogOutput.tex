\section{Log Output} \label{sec:log_output}
This section generally defines the form of Instalog's output. A log is split up
into several delimited portions called ``sections''. With the exception of
headers and footers, all sections begin with a line similar to the following
format:

\begin{verbatim}
================ ${Section Name} ===============
\end{verbatim}

That is, the name of the section with one space of padding, centered in a block
of equals (\verb|=|) signs 50 total characters wide. In the case that a tie
exists with respect to the centering, Instalog shall prefer placing the name of the
section farther to the right than to the left.

\subsection{Default Script Sections} \label{sec:default_script_sections}
Instalog's standard (that is, run without a script) output consists of the
following sections in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Header
    \item Running Processes
    \item Machine PsuedoHJT Report
    \item $n$ User PseudoHJT Reports (One for each loaded user registry on the
    system)
    \item Mozilla Firefox (If Mozilla Firefox is installed)
    \item Google Chrome (If Google Chrome is installed)
    \item Created Last 30
    \item Find3M Report
    \item Event Viewer (If any relevant events need be reported)
    \item Machine Specifications
    \item Restore Points
    \item Installed Programs
    \item Footer
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional Script Sections}
\noindent{}The following additional sections are available but they are not
generated in the default report:
\begin{description}
\item[DNS Check] Displayed if the \verb|:dnscheck| scripting section is used.
\item[Directory] Displayed if the \verb|:dirlook| scripting section is used.
\item[VirusTotal] Displayed if the \verb|:virustotal| scripting section is used.
\item[MRC Upload] Displayed if the \verb|:mrc| scripting section is used.

is used.
\item[Registry 32 Bit] Displayed if the \verb|:reg32| scripting action is used.
\item[Registry 64 Bit] Displayed if the \verb|:reg64| scripting action is used.
\end{description}

\subsection{Escaping Formats}
In order to meet the requirements of machine readability and human readability,
several escaping formats must be used depending on the type of data to produce
the most readable unambiguous representation given typical data collected from a
given location.

\subsubsection{General Escaping Format}
Generally, escaping MUST be done in a manner similar to most programming
languages, such as C, C++, Java, or similar, for quoted string escapes. Such an
escaping scheme is defined by three characters: an optional starting delimiter,
an optional termination delimiter, and an escape character. For instance, in C,
the starting delimiter is the quote mark, \verb|"|, the ending delimiter is also
a quote mark \verb|"|, and the escape character is the backslash \verb|\|.

For most types of information Instalog enumerates, such as Windows file paths,
the exact method C uses is unsuitable; backslashes occur far too often inside
file paths for the backslash as an escape character to make a good choice.
Legacy applications like the command processor (\texttt{cmd.exe}) get around
such problems by implementing complicated escaping schemes, but these are
designed with specific input data in mind (file paths and command line
switches, for instance), which is not the case for most reported data.

\label{generalescape}
Therefore, we define a general escape function that works in a manner similar to
C's string literal escapes, but which allows arbitrary starting, termination,
and escaping characters. The input to the escape function is raw data obtained
from some data source, and the output is the same data with the following
textual replacements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \var{EscapeCharacter} is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\var{EscapeCharacter}.
    \item \var{RightDelimiter}, if defined,  is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\var{RightDelimiter}.
    \item The null character (ASCII \verb|0x00|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{0}.
    \item The backspace character (ASCII \verb|0x08|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{b}.
    \item The form feed character (ASCII \verb|0x0C|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{f}.
    \item The newline character (ASCII \verb|0x0A|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{n}.
    \item The carriage return character (ASCII \verb|0x0D|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{r}.
    \item The horizontal tab character (ASCII \verb|0x09|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{t}.
    \item The vertical tab character (ASCII \verb|0x0B|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{v}.
    \item ASCII characters which are not in the above list but are unprintable
    (that is, ASCII \verb|0x00| - \verb|0x1F|; \verb|0x7F|) are
    replaced with \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{xHH}, where \texttt{HH} is the
    hexadecimal representation of the numeric value of the given character.
    \item Non-ASCII characters (\verb|U+0080| and above) are replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{uHHHH}, where \texttt{HHHH} is the hexadecimal
    representation of the numeric value of the character.
    \item Unicode characters requiring a surrogate pair in UTF-16 (that is,
    greater than U+FFFF) are represented as two normal Unicode
    (\var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{uHHHH}) escapes matching the UTF-16 surrogate
    pair. (This is exactly how they'd be represented in Windows itself.)
    \item Forum software destroys significant whitespace; but escaping every
    space would be impractical. Where there is more than a single consecutive
    space, the second and later spaces are escaped. (That is, replaced with
    ``\var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{ }''.)
    \item Any instance of \var{EscapeCharacter} followed by an unused character
    in the above list is equivalent to that character with no escape. This will
    never be generated by the escaping functionality in Instalog for general
    escaping, but is valid for the reverse, unescaping, operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{URL Escaping Format} \label{urlescape}
URL escaping matches the general escaping format above, except has the
additional constraint of forum software which tries to convert URLs into links.
It is desirable to inhibit this behavior of the forum software, so that board
owners need not worry about linking to malicious websites. Therefore, URL
escaping is defined to be general escaping with the additional requirement that
when the string ``\texttt{http}'' (case insensitive) appears in the source, it
is replaced with ``\texttt{htt}\var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{p}''. This inhibits
forum software's URL behavior which looks for the protocol prefix in order to
determine what portions of a post indicate a link. (Note that due to the last
requirement of general escaping this will cause no effect on the unescaped data).

\subsection{PseudoHJT Machine Report}
The information in the PseudoHJT report MUST closely match the information
displayed by the original HJT tool. The format MUST closely match the syntax of
a similar predecessor, DDS, so that forum volunteers need not learn
significantly different syntax to that which they know. This format MUST be
sparse and human readable. Perhaps most importantly, despite matching the
original HJT in terms of information conveyed, the format itself MUST be
different enough to avoid legal action by TrendMicro against Instalog's authors.

Generally speaking, the PseudoHJT report attempts to list all relevant loading
points on a Windows machine, as well as user settings for the Internet Explorer
browser; such as home page, search provider, and title settings. The report is
heavily whitelisted. Items which are defaults on Windows MUST NOT be emitted,
unless whitelisting has been disabled. Specific whitelisting schemes are given
per type of line shown in the PseudoHJT report.

Each line in the PseudoHJT report is given a unique prefix, which is not shared
by other line types. This allows the line to be unambiguously understood by the
Instalog GUI, and other kinds of inspection tools.

The ``Data Sources'' sections in the definitions below make use of standard
registry script, as defined by \verb|regedit.exe|, which is shipped as a
standard Windows operating system component. A full specification for this
format can be found on Wikipedia
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#.REG_files}) and other
similar sources.

\subsubsection{User Default Page URL}
\begin{description}
\item[Rationale] \hfill \\
The User Default Page URL is the location(s) of pages opened when a user creates
a new Microsoft Internet Explorer window, or starts the browser for the first
time. If this value is set, it overrides the machine-wide Default Page URL
value. This setting affects 32 bit versions of Internet Explorer only.
\item[Data Sources] \hfill
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
; 32 Bit Registry View
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer]
"Default_Page_URL"="${url}"
\end{verbatim}
\item[Log Format] \hfill
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim} 
uDefaultPageUrl=${url}
\end{verbatim}
\item[Output Description] \hfill \\
The variable \var{url} is escaped using the
URL escaping scheme defined in \ref{urlescape}, where the escape character is the
hash mark (\verb|#|). 
\item[Whitelist Considerations] \hfill \\
The default value for this entry
differs depending on the version of Internet Explorer and Windows currently in
use. Testing will need to be undertaken against supported operating systems in
order to determine which values to hide.
\item[Fix Considerations] \hfill \\
Valid options: fix registry. Generated
script:
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
:reg32
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer]
"Default_Page_URL"="about:blank"
\end{verbatim}
