\section{Log Output} \label{sec:log_output}
This section generally defines the form of Instalog's output. A log is split up
into several delimited portions called ``sections''. With the exception of
headers and footers, all sections begin with a line similar to the following
format:

\begin{verbatim}
================ ${Section Name} ===============
\end{verbatim}

That is, the name of the section with one space of padding, centered in a block
of equals (\verb|=|) signs 50 total characters wide. In the case that a tie
exists with respect to the centering, Instalog shall prefer placing the name of
the section farther to the right than to the left.

\subsection{Default Script Sections} \label{sec:default_script_sections}
Instalog's standard (that is, run without a script) output consists of the
following sections in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Header
    \item Running Processes
    \item Machine PsuedoHJT Report
    \item $n$ User PseudoHJT Reports (One for each loaded user registry on the
    system)
    \item Mozilla Firefox (If Mozilla Firefox is installed)
    \item Google Chrome (If Google Chrome is installed)
    \item Created Last 30
    \item Find3M Report
    \item Event Viewer (If any relevant events need be reported)
    \item Machine Specifications
    \item Restore Points
    \item Installed Programs
    \item Footer
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional Script Sections}
\noindent{}The following additional sections are available but they are not
generated in the default report:
\begin{description}

\end{description}

\subsection{Escaping Formats}
In order to meet the requirements of machine readability and human readability,
several escaping formats must be used depending on the type of data to produce
the most readable unambiguous representation given typical data collected from a
given location.

\subsubsection{General Escaping Format}
Generally, escaping MUST be done in a manner similar to most programming
languages, such as C, C++, Java, or similar, for quoted string escapes. Such an
escaping scheme is defined by three characters: an optional starting delimiter,
an optional termination delimiter, and an escape character. For instance, in C,
the starting delimiter is the quote mark, \verb|"|, the ending delimiter is also
a quote mark \verb|"|, and the escape character is the backslash \verb|\|.

For most types of information Instalog enumerates, such as Windows file paths,
the exact method C uses is unsuitable; backslashes occur far too often inside
file paths for the backslash as an escape character to make a good choice.
Legacy applications like the command processor (\texttt{cmd.exe}) get around
such problems by implementing complicated escaping schemes, but these are
designed with specific input data in mind (file paths and command line
switches, for instance), which is not the case for most reported data.

\label{generalescape}
Therefore, we define a general escape function that works in a manner similar to
C's string literal escapes, but which allows arbitrary starting, termination,
and escaping characters. The input to the escape function is raw data obtained
from some data source, and the output is the same data with the following
textual replacements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \var{EscapeCharacter} is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\var{EscapeCharacter}.
    \item \var{RightDelimiter}, if defined,  is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\var{RightDelimiter}.
    \item The null character (ASCII \verb|0x00|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{0}.
    \item The backspace character (ASCII \verb|0x08|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{b}.
    \item The form feed character (ASCII \verb|0x0C|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{f}.
    \item The newline character (ASCII \verb|0x0A|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{n}.
    \item The carriage return character (ASCII \verb|0x0D|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{r}.
    \item The horizontal tab character (ASCII \verb|0x09|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{t}.
    \item The vertical tab character (ASCII \verb|0x0B|) is replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{v}.
    \item ASCII characters which are not in the above list but are unprintable
    (that is, ASCII \verb|0x00| - \verb|0x1F|; \verb|0x7F|) are
    replaced with \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{xHH}, where \texttt{HH} is the
    hexadecimal representation of the numeric value of the given character.
    \item Non-ASCII characters (\verb|U+0080| and above) are replaced with
    \var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{uHHHH}, where \texttt{HHHH} is the hexadecimal
    representation of the numeric value of the character.
    \item Unicode characters requiring a surrogate pair in UTF-16 (that is,
    greater than U+FFFF) are represented as two normal Unicode
    (\var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{uHHHH}) escapes matching the UTF-16 surrogate
    pair. (This is exactly how they'd be represented in Windows itself.)
    \item Forum software destroys significant whitespace; but escaping every
    space would be impractical. Where there is more than a single consecutive
    space, the second and later spaces are escaped. (That is, replaced with
    ``\var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{ }''.)
    \item Any instance of \var{EscapeCharacter} followed by an unused character
    in the above list is equivalent to that character with no escape. This will
    never be generated by the escaping functionality in Instalog for general
    escaping, but is valid for the reverse, unescaping, operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{URL Escaping Format} \label{urlescape}
URL escaping matches the general escaping format above, except has the
additional constraint of forum software which tries to convert URLs into links.
It is desirable to inhibit this behavior of the forum software, so that board
owners need not worry about linking to malicious websites. Therefore, URL
escaping is defined to be general escaping with the additional requirement that
when the string ``\texttt{http}'' (case insensitive) appears in the source, it
is replaced with ``\texttt{htt}\var{EscapeCharacter}\texttt{p}''. This inhibits
forum software's URL behavior which looks for the protocol prefix in order to
determine what portions of a post indicate a link. (Note that due to the last
requirement of general escaping this will cause no effect on the unescaped data).

\subsection{Header}
The header of an Instalog report consists of 4 lines, which are always displayed
and shown in the same order as defined in this document. No component of the
header is associated with any type of fix information.

The first line lists information about Instalog itself. It is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
Instalog ${Version}${SafebootState}
\end{verbatim}

\var{Version} is the version number of the current release of Instalog. This
allows remote determination of cases where a user needs to upgrade their current
copy before malware removal or system repair can continue safely.

\var{SafebootState} is the string ``\verb| MINIMAL|'' if the system is currently
booted into Windows' \textit{Safe Mode}, or the string ``\verb| NETWORK|'' if
the system is booted into \textit{Safe Mode with Networking}, or nothing if the
machine was booted normally.

The second line lists information about the user running Instalog, and the local
date and time of the system when the log was generated. It has the form:
\begin{verbatim}
Run by ${UserName} at ${Y}-${M}-${D} ${H}:${M}:${S}.${Milli} [GMT ${TimeZone}]
\end{verbatim}

\var{UserName} is the current display name of the logged in user, escaped with
the general escaping format defined in \ref{generalescape}, using a left
delimiter of a double quote (\verb|"|), a right delimiter of a double
quote (\verb|"|), and an escape character backslash (\verb|\|).

\var{Y}, \var{M}, \var{D}, \var{H}, \var{M}, \var{S}, and \var{Milli} are
replaced with numeric representations of the current local date and time (that
is, year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond, respectively).

\var{TimeZone} is a one sign, three digit, and one decimal point representation
of the time zone of the machine taking the report. For instance, Eastern
Standard Time is \verb|-4.00| or \verb|-5.00|, while Moscow Standard Time would
be \verb|+4.00|. (The extra two digits are to allow for locales with half and
quarter hour time zones)

The third line is designed to indicate when important exploitable applications
need to be updated, by listing their versions. It has the form:
\begin{verbatim}
IE: ${IE} Java: ${Java} Flash: ${Flash} Adobe: ${AdobeReader}
\end{verbatim}

The variables are the installed versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer,
Oracle's Java, Adobe's Flash, and Adobe's Adobe Reader. In the event one or more
of these applications are not installed then their version is listed as
``\verb|None|''.

The fourth line contains information about the current Windows installation and
memory state. It is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
Microsoft Windows ${WindowsVersion} ${WindowsEdition} ${ProcessorArchitecture}
${Major}.${Minor}.${Build}.${ServicePack} ${FreeRam}/${TotalRam} MB Free
\end{verbatim}

Newlines in the above are a consequence of this document and are not present in
the output.

\var{WindowsVersion} is the ``string name'' of the version of Windows in use,
such as ``XP'', ``Vista'', or ``7''. \var{WindowsEdition} is the edition of the
same; such as ``Home'', ``Professional'', or ``Ultimate''. The values
\var{Major}, \var{Minor}, \var{Build}, and \var{ServicePack} match the current
version information of the operating system in use.

\var{ProcesserArchitecture} is either the string ``\verb|x86|'' or
``\verb|x64|'', matching the installed operating system type. (Note that this is
\textit{not} the capability of the current processor)

Finally, \var{FreeRam} and \var{TotalRam} are the number of Mebibytes of memory
that are available for use by programs on the current running system.

Examples of the 4th line:
\begin{verbatim}
Microsoft Windows Vista Professional N x86 6.0.6000.0 1023/8096 MB Free
Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate x64 6.1.7601.1 4547/8071 MB Free
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{PseudoHJT Report General}
The information in the PseudoHJT report must closely match the information
displayed by the original HJT tool. The format must closely match the syntax of
a similar predecessor, DDS, so that forum volunteers need not learn
significantly different syntax to that which they know. This format MUST be
sparse and human readable. Perhaps most importantly, despite matching the
original HJT in terms of information conveyed, the format itself MUST be
different enough to avoid legal action by TrendMicro against Instalog's authors.

Generally speaking, the PseudoHJT report shall attempt to list all relevant
loading points on a Windows machine, as well as user settings for the Internet
Explorer browser; such as home page, search provider, and title settings. The
report shall be heavily whitelisted. Items which are defaults on Windows shall
not be emitted, unless whitelisting has been disabled. Specific whitelisting
schemes are given per type of line shown in the PseudoHJT report.

Each line in the PseudoHJT report is given a unique prefix, which is not shared
by other line types. This allows the line to be unambiguously understood by the
Instalog GUI, and other kinds of inspection tools.

For either PseudoHJT section in the Instalog GUI, two checkboxes are available
if defined by the lines below: \textbf{Move} and \textbf{Fix} (in that order).
Move, generally speaking, will generate script to quarantine a file associated
with an entry, and Fix will generate script to reset settings to a default
state, or delete loading points.

\subsection{PseudoHJT Machine Report}
The PseudoHJT machine report contains settings which affect the entire machine.
Settings in this section can generally be overridden by settings in the user
report. Such cases are documented here.

\subsection{PseudoHJT User Report}
The PseudoHJT user report is specific to a given user on the target machine.
There will be a separate such section for each user that is loaded into the
registry at the time Instalog is run (that is, loaded into \verb|HKEY_USERS|).

The first line of the user report indicates which SID and name the user has, and
is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
Identity: "${username}" ${sid}
\end{verbatim}

The variable \var{username} refers to the display name of the user being
enumerated. It is escaped using the general escaping method defined in
\ref{generalescape}, using a right delimiter of \verb|"|, and an escape
character of \verb|\|. The \var{sid} is the security identifier associated with
that user. It follows a regular format, and therefore need not be escaped.

The variable \var{CurrentUser} is used several times below in registry sections.
This variable expands to the value of the currently being checked user hive,
such as
\begin{verbatim}
HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-2812505617-3763003962-1231251036-1000
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Default Page URL}

\subsection{Mozilla Firefox}
Mozilla Firefox (hereafter referred to as simply ``Firefox'') is a popular web
browser that many users have installed on their machines.  An attack from within
the browser is a possibility.  As such, this tool must enumerate various Firefox
loading points to find suspicious information (if Firefox is installed).  This
can be determined by checking to see if the \var{version} is set in the
following registry key:
% TODO: Do I have to put any 32/64 bit information here? 
\begin{verbatim}
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox] 
"Current Version"="${version}
\end{verbatim}

This specification is targeted for Firefox 10.0 x86 builds.  The behavior is
undefined for other versions of Firefox but will likely be similar.

\subsubsection{Profile}
\begin{description}
\item[Rationale] \hfill \\
Firefox stores its user settings in ``profiles''.  Each profile is a directory
on disk.  
\item[Data Sources] \hfill \\
The profiles are stored in the following location:
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\${profilefolder}
\end{verbatim}
There can be several profiles installed for each user.   All profiles in this
directory with randomly generated folder names of 8 characters.  The profile
that starts up when Firefox loads will be in the randomly named folder appended
by ``\verb|.default|''.  It should be sufficient to only enumerate the default
profile for the currently logged in user.
\item[Log Format] \hfill 
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
ProfilePath ${profilepath}
\end{verbatim}
\item[Output Description] \hfill \\
\var{profilepath} is the full path to the profile escaped using the scheme
defined in \ref{generalescape}, where the escape character is the hash mark
(\verb|#|) and the right delimiter is just the newline.
\item[Whitelist Considerations] \hfill \\
This item cannot be whitelisted as it is unique to each user's machine.
\item[Fix Considerations] \hfill \\
There are no fix actions associated with the profile path.  The profile path is
provided so that further fix actions can be applied to components within the
path.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{User Preferences}
\begin{description}
\item[Rationale] \hfill \\
Some user preferences could be overridden that would lead a user to malicious
pages.  
\item[Data Sources] \hfill \\
User preferences are located in the ``\verb|${profile path}/prefs.js|'' file. 
The preferences are saved in the JSON format. There are several different
``loading points'' from this file that could be important for diagnosing an
infection:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \verb|browser.startup.homepage|
  \item \verb|network.proxy.type|
\end{enumerate}
\item[Log Format] \hfill 
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
${preference}=${value}
\end{verbatim}
\item[Output Description] \hfill \\
\var{preference} is the preference name from the settings file, and \var{value}
is the corresponding value for the setting.  \var{value} must be escaped using
the URL escaping scheme defined in \ref{urlescape}, where the escape character
is the hash mark (\verb|#|).
\item[Whitelist Considerations] \hfill \\
The default values for each preference should be whitelisted.  These values are
enumerated below:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \verb|browser.startup.homepage = about:home|
  \item \verb|network.proxy.type = 5|
\end{enumerate}

\item[Fix Considerations] \hfill \\
A sensible fix for these items is to simply delete the corresponding key and
value from \verb|prefs.js|.  Firefox will then reset the preference to the
default value the next time it loads.

Firefox must not be running for this to work.  If a script is supposed to fix
any of the preferences and Firefox is running, a dialog must appear warning the
user that Firefox will be closed.  When the user hits okay in this dialog, the
Firefox process can be killed if it is still running and the preference(s)
reset.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Extensions}
\begin{description}
\item[Rationale] \hfill \\
Firefox allows users to add to the functionality of their browser through
``extensions'' (sometimes called addons).  These extensions can be malicious in
nature.  Extensions need not be installed by the user; they can be installed
outside Firefox as well by placing extensions in the profile directory and
relaunching Firefox.  
\item[Data Sources] \hfill \\
Extension metadata is stored in an SQLite 3 database located in \\
\verb|${profilepath}/extensions.sqlite|.  There are two tables in this database
that are of interest: \verb|addon| and \verb|locale|.  
\item[Log Format] \hfill 
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
Extension ${visible} ${active} "${name} ${version} ${type} ${id} ${path}
\end{verbatim}
\item[Output Description] \hfill \\
The output variables are defined as:
\begin{description}
  \item[\var{visible}] \verb|addon.visible| attribute.  This shall be output as
  a binary 0 or 1 value.
  \item[\var{active}] \verb|addon.active| attribute.  This shall be output as a
  binary 0 or 1 value.
  \item[\var{name}] \verb|locale.name| attribute where \texttt{locale.id =
  addon.defaultLocale}.  This shall be escaped according to the scheme defined
  in \ref{generalescape} with \verb|#| as the escape character and double quotes
  (\verb|"|) as the right delimiter.
  \item[\var{version}] \verb|addon.version| attribute
  \item[\var{type}] \verb|addon.type| attribute
  \item[\var{id}] \verb|addon.id| attribute
  \item[\var{path}] \verb|addon.descriptor| attribute.  This shall be escaped
  according to the scheme defined in \ref{generalescape} with \# as the
  escape character and the newline as the right delimiter.  
\end{description}
\item[Whitelist Considerations] \hfill \\
No whitelist actions apply here
\item[Fix Considerations] \hfill \\
To fix these items, the \var{path} simply needs to be deleted.  This must
happen while Firefox is not running.  If a script is supposed to fix an
extension and Firefox is running, a dialog must appear warning the user that
Firefox will be closed.  When the user hits okay in this dialog, the Firefox
process can be killed if it is still running.  When the user re-opens Firefox
later, the extension(s) will be removed from the database.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Plugins}
\begin{description}
\item[Rationale] \hfill \\
Firefox, like most major browsers, supports plugins.  These are a potential
attack vector and should be scanned.  
\item[Data Sources] \hfill \\
Firefox maintains a list of plugins in \texttt{\var{profilepath}/pluginreg.dat}.
This file is structured in a specific way.  Everything below the line labeled
``\texttt{[PLUGINS]}'' is imported for this tool.  Each plugin is listed below
this line, each in its own ``block''.  These ``block'' are all structured
similarly, and follow the same format:
\begin{verbatim}
${file name}|$
${full file path}|$
${version}|$
${installed timestamp}|${unknown?}|${unknown?}|$
${description}|$
${name}|$
${mime type count}
0|${mime type}|$
1|${mime type}|$
...
${${mime type count} minus 1}|${mime type}|$
\end{verbatim}
Each plugin ``block'' is put immediately after the last plugin ``block'' with no
other separation.  It should be enough to read through to the
``\texttt{[PLUGINS]}'' line and keep parsing ``block'' until the
``\texttt{[INVALID]}'' line is reached.
\item[Log Format] \hfill 
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{verbatim}
Plugin "${name} ${version} ${path}
\end{verbatim}
\item[Output Description] \hfill \\
\var{name}, \var{version}, and \var{path} are from the \texttt{pluginreg.dat}
file described above.  \var{name} shall be escaped according to the scheme
defined in \ref{generalescape} with \verb|#| as the escape character and double
quotes (\verb|"|) as the right delimiter.  \var{path} shall be escaped
according to \ref{generalescape} as well with \verb|#| as the escape character
and the newline as the right delimiter.  
\item[Whitelist Considerations] \hfill \\
No whitelist actions are necessary.  
\item[Fix Considerations] \hfill \\
To fix these items, the \var{path} simply needs to be deleted.  This must
happen while Firefox is not running.  If a script is supposed to fix an
plugin and Firefox is running, a dialog must appear warning the user that
Firefox will be closed.  When the user hits okay in this dialog, the Firefox
process can be killed if it is still running.  When the user re-opens Firefox
later, the plugins(s) will be removed from the file.
