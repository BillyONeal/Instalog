\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document Conventions}
Within the scope of this document, computer output or other information that is
to be taken literally is written in \texttt{fixed width text}. In some
instances, a block of fixed width text will be surrounded by non-fixed width
quotes ``\texttt{ like this}''. In such cases, the quotes are not significant,
and there will there will (typically) be leading or trailing space around the
fixed width block, which is significant and MUST NOT be removed. Variables,
which are replaced with some content, are written of the form \var{name}, and
will be explained in greater detail in prose surrounding a given block of
\texttt{fixed width} text.

Portions of this document are written in terms of the \verb|.REG| format
described by Regedit, a windows component. The syntax for the regedit script is
described in several locations, such as Wikipedia
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#.REG_files}).

We define an extended version of this syntax in section \ref{sec:registry},
which may also be considered a reference.
