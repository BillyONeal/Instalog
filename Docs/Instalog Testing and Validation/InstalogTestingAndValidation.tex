\section{Introduction}
This document describes the testing and validation processes for the Instalog
tool.  Please note that this document is a work in progress, and is developed as
development progresses on the tool.  

Testing and validation for this tool are extremely important.  Since this tool
makes serious modifications to Windows to remove malware, it is extremely
important that the tool be tested to minimize the likelihood of destroying
users' machines.  Since the current development phase is focused on scanning,
testing isn't \textit{as} important because scanning does not modify the machine
in any way.  However, since many of the components developed to aid in the
scanning features will also be used in the system modification features, it is
still important to test these components extensively.

Once the scanning features are done, this document will be revisited and updated
with the testing and validation plans for the system-modifying features.

\section{Testing} \label{testing}
\subsection{Test-Driven Development} \label{test-driven-development}
The main form of testing at this point for the project is unit testing in
test-driven development.  In the development of any code, the tests are written
in conjunction with the implementation.  This allows the code to be modified
with less fear of breaking things.  It also lends itself well to validation
(see section~\ref{validation}).  Currently, this is the only type of testing
done on the project because the components do not interact with each other, so
unit testing each component is sufficient.

At the time of this writing, the test suite for the project contains over two
hundred tests.

\section{Validation} \label{validation}
\subsection{Operating System Support Validation}
Validation for the tool is fairly straight-forward at this point.  Once the
scanning sections are implemented and deemed working on the authors' machines,
the test suite from section~\ref{test-driven-development} will be run on all
target operating systems in virtual machines to make sure everything runs
smoothly.  In addition, the output from the scanning component will be examined
to ensure that everything seems normal.  Ideally, this process shouldn't take
long as there isn't much difference between the different operating systems that
this tool will support.

\subsection{Field Validation}
In addition to testing on virtual machines, a beta version of the test suite and
scanning binary will be released to friends and ``forum experts'' in the field. 
The test suite and tool will be run on these machines to make sure that
everything works on ``real world'' machines as opposed to simply the virtual
machines that the authors have access to.
