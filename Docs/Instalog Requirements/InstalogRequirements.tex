\section{Intended Users} \label{users}
Instalog is designed with three types of target users in mind. These ``user
classes'' are listed in the following sections.

\subsection{Home Users}
For a typical home user, Instalog must not display a complicated interface, and
must make it relatively difficult to misstep and take a wrong action. Few
options need be presented, such as the ability to generate a default report and
the ability to take a given script and run it on a target machine. Complicated
features such as analysis must not be displayed; though they may appear as
options that are, by default, deselected.

\subsection{Administrators}
Administrators are similar to home users in that they are physically working at
a computer being examined, but they are different in that they have the intent of
repairing their own computer or the computer of a client. They wish to see
analysis features and more possible options. Instalog must provide a means for
Administrators to use it's analysis features without manual saving and reloading
of log files.

\subsection{Forum Experts}
Forum Experts help typical end users repair their machines remotely over
self-help forums such as BleepingComputer.com or GeeksToGo.com.
These users work remotely, and likely will never see a given target
machine.
Instalog must produce log formats that are human readable in the vast majority
of cases, but which can be passed through common forum software such as Invision
Power Board, phpBB, or vBulletin without destruction of information.
Unfortunately, this makes common data exchange formats such as JSON and XML
unsuitable. 

Moreover, as obtaining additional information from a machine may
have lead times of several days, Instalog's report must be unambiguous; that is,
no two possible system configurations may produce the same output. Experts can
also benefit from log analysis features. Finally, Experts need to be able to
write simple, human readable scripts to perform actions to fix a user's machine
remotely.

\section{Scripting Requirements} \label{scripting}
The main functionality of this tool will be implemented with ``scripts.''  Each
script will specify what actions should be taken by the tool.  For instance, the
default scan in section~\ref{scanning} could be implemented with a script. 
Scripts can also be written by users either by hand or by using the GUI
(section~\ref{gui}).  As such, scripts should be written in human-readable text.
Since scripts will frequently be posted to online forums, the script format must
be designed such that information will not be lost when posting to forums
(whitespace, URLs, unicode characters, etc.).  Not only should scripts be
capable of scanning a machine, this is also the method that Instalog will use
for repairing a user's machine (section~\ref{repair}).

\newpage



\section{Output Requirements} \label{output}
Each script that is run (see section~\ref{scripting}) will produce some sort of
output.  The general form of the output log is that it will be composed of a
header, output split into sections, and a footer. The header of the output log
will contain various information about the system that it run on (Instalog
version, Windows version, date/time of the run, etc.). The output from the
script will be split into separate ``sections,'' each section with various
associated details.  The footer will be a short ending to the log that will
basically ensure that the entire document is complete.  

Like the scripting language, the output shall be designed such that it can be
pasted into forums and other websites.  It should also be human-readable as well
as machine-parsable to support either an expert with a text editor or the GUI
workflow through the tool.  

\newpage



\section{Scanning Requirements} \label{scanning}
One of the main functionalities of Instalog is its ability to scan a machine to
gather information that will be useful for system diagnostics.  There are a
number of different scan features that the tool will support.  These features
are briefly described below.

\begin{description}
    \item[Running Processes] This will list the currently running processes for
    all users on the machine.
    \item[PsuedoHJT Report] This will implement functionality similar to
    \textit{Hijack This} or \textit{DDS}.  It will run for the machine as well
    as for each user on the system.
    \item[Mozilla Firefox] This will common Firefox infection routes including
    but not limited to extensions, plugins, and preferences.
    \item[Google Chrome] This will common Chrome infection routes including
    but not limited to extensions, plugins, and preferences.
    \item[Services/Drivers] This will list all of the services and drivers on a
    system.
    \item[Created Last 30] This is designed to be the same report as the Created
    Last 30 report from \textit{DDS}, which lists the files from target
    locations that have been updated in the last thirty days.
    \item[Find3M] This is designed to be the same report as the Find3M report
    from \textit{DDS}, which essentially lists ``interesting'' files that have
    been updated in the last three months.
    \item[Event Viewer] This will report any problems in the Windows event log.
    \item[Machine Specifications] This will list important system specifications
    such as processor type, disk partitions, etc.
    \item[Restore Points] This will list all existing restore points.
    \item[Installed Programs] This will list all installed programs.
\end{description}

Each of these options will run in the default scanning script.  Each option
should also be callable from a custom script as described in
section~\ref{scripting}.  All of these actions are designed to be non-invasive,
meaning that they should not modify the user's machine in any way.

\newpage



\section{Repair Action Requirements} \label{repair}
As opposed to script actions (section~\ref{scripting}), repair actions are
system modifying and as such, should be used more cautiously.  Instalog should
support the following repair actions:

\begin{description}
\item[Kill Process] This will kill the process(es) matching the specified query.
\item[VirusTotal Upload] This will upload specified file(s) to VirusTotal, an
online tool that scans files using all major antivirus tools.
\item[MRC Upload] This will upload specified file(s) to Malware Bytes' online
virus database.
\item[File Quarantine] As opposed to simply deleting files, the repair action is
instead to ``quarantine'' them, which means to move them from their original
location to a safe location.
\item[Hosts File Reset] This action will restore the Hosts file to a sensible
default.
\item[Mozilla Firefox Fixes] These actions will fix various Firefox problems
that are scanned for.  
\item[Google Chrome] These actions will fix various Chrome problems
that are scanned for.  
\item[Security Center] This will remove specified security registrations.
\item[Registry] This will run standard reg script and maintain a backup.
\item[LSP Chain] This will manipulate the LSP chain in the registry and then fix
after all specified operations have completed.
\item[Directory Listing] This will simply enumerate the contents of a directory
\item[DNS Check] This will run a DNS check on the supplied domain.
\end{description}

One very important requirement of fix script actions is that they MUST create a
backup before they proceed so that the action taken can be reverted.  

\newpage



\section{Graphical User Interface Requirements} \label{gui}
The graphical user interface will be the only method for interfacing with this
tool.  The interface is designed such that it will enable all three of the user
classes described in section~\ref{users} to go through their appropriate
workflows.  As such, the GUI must bridge the gap between being simple enough for
home users to use yet complicated enough for power users to build complex fix
scripts.  This balance is achieved by splitting the GUI up into several screens
for completing various parts of the workflow.  The GUI should remain response
through all actions. 

Like the other sections, enumerating all of the requirements and specifications
of this would be beyond the scope of this document.  This being said, the GUI
should include the following screens:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Main screen
  \item Running screen
  \item Run completed screen
  \item Analysis screen
  \item Analysis complete screen
  \item Finished screen
\end{enumerate}

Despite having a GUI, experts should still be able to read output logs and edit
fix scripts in a text editor.  

\newpage



\section{Other Requirements}
\subsection{Target Operating Systems}
Instalog will support all Microsoft Windows NT variants released later than
Windows 2000 for x86 and x64 based computers.  Specifically, this tool shall
support:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Windows 2000 (x86, SP4 only)
  \item Windows XP (x86 and x64, RTM, SP1, SP2 and SP3 (on x85 machines))
  \item Windows Vista (x86 and x64, RTM, SP1, and SP2)
  \item Windows 7 (x86 and x64, RTM and SP1)
  \item Windows Server 2003 (x86 and x64, RTM, SP1, SP2)
  \item Windows Server 2003 R2 (x86 and x64, RTM, SP1, and SP2)
  \item Windows Server 2008 (x86 and x64, RTM, SP1, and SP2)
  \item Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64, RTM, and SP1)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internationalization}
The tool should be easy translate to other languages.  The script language and
output language need not be changed.  Basically, the only thing that would need
to be translated would be the GUI assets.
